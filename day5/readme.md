## How to choose?

Here are some questions to help you choose the right framework:

* Do you already have a trusted partner?
* Which frameworks integrates nicely with your existing technology stack (e.g. programming language, frameworks, cloud provider, monitoring, etc.)?
* No code, low code, or deep code?
* Are you focussing on one LLM provider or do you need to support multiple providers?
* Do you have specific functional requirements that are only met by specific frameworks?
* Is local or hybrid development required?
* How complex will your agent landscape be on the short, medium, and long term?
* Which types of agents are you looking to build (e.g. chatbots, RAG agents, task agents, etc.)?
* Is using OSS a requirement?
* Price is always a factor.
* What is the lifecycle of the agentic system you are looking to build (e.g. prototype, pilot, long-termin production, etc.)?
